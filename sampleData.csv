What are the acellular organisms studied in Microbiology?,"Viruses, viroids, satellites, prions",Topic 1
Define: Virus,"- acellular

Contrast: Viroid and virus,Viroids lack the protein coat that viruses have,Topic 1
Compare: Viroid and virus,Both have RNA/DNA,
Define: Satellite,A subviral agent that requires a co-infector (helper or master virus) to infect a cell,Topic 1
Define: Prion,"- misfolded protein
- 'infectious' - can conformationally change normal protein on contact
- no cure for prion diseases
- diseases known as spongiform encephalopathy",Topic 1
Why are microorganisms important? (6),"- first living organisms
- msot populous group of organisms and ubiquitous in distribution
- ecosystems depend on activities (i.e. as detritivores)
- source of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen fixing, photosynthesis)
- biotechnology (i.e. food microbiology)
- can cause global influence (i.e. Irish potato famine)","Topic 1, list"
What is the historical significance of the Irish Potato Famine? What caused it?,"The Irish Potato Famine causes a massive immigration to North America to escape starvation, as a fungus causing potato rot destroyed a large portion of the Irish food supply.",Topic 1
What microbe causes the bubonic plague?,Yersinia pestis,"Topic 1, microbe"
What disease does Yersinia pestis cause? How is it transmitted?,Bubonic plague - carried by fleas.,"Topic 1, microbe"
What were the medieval treatment methods of disease? (3),"- Isolation
- Destruction of ""contaminated"" material
- Natural remedies (often placebo)",Topic 1
What is the major contribution of Fracastoro?,Suggested that invisible organisms causes disease (which eventually became germ theory).,"Topic 1, person"
Who first suggested that invisible organisms cause disease?,Fracastoro,"Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of Leeuwenhoek?,"First direct observations of bacteria through the first functional microscope.

He used a small glass bead in an apparatus to see 'animalcules'.","Topic 1, person"
Who is responsible for the first direct observations of bacteria?,Leeuwenhoek through the first functional microscope.,"Topic 1, person"
Define: Spontaneous Generation,The idea that living organisms can develop from nonliving or decomposing matter,Topic 1
What is the major contribution of Redi? How?,"Disproved spontaneous generation for higher organisms.

He showed that covered meat will not develop maggots, while uncovered meat was exposed to flies, and their maggot offspring.","Topic 1, person"
Who disproved spontaneous generation in higher organisms? How?,"Redi.

He showed that covered meat will not develop maggots, while uncovered meat was exposed to flies, and their maggot offspring.","Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of Needham? How?,"The misconception that spontaneous generation occurs in microorganisms.

He boiled mutton, then sealed it, but microorganisms invaded between the boiling and sealing, causing the broth to become cloudy","Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of Spallanzani? How?,"Gave support against spontaneous generation for microorganisms. Concluded that either air carried germs to the medium, or a 'vital force' required for life is present in air, but is destroyed by heating.

He sealed broth in flasks, then boiled it. There was no growth of microorganisms in the flask.","Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of Pasteur? How?,"Disproved spontaneous generation.

Used swan-neck flask to isolate the boiled broth from microorganisms. Air could freely move, but microbes would be trapped in the lower section of the neck.","Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of Jenner? How?,"Developed the first vaccine (for smallpox).

Observed that milkmaids did not contract smallpox. Concluded that cowpox infection gave resistance to smallpox. He infected a child with cowpox, allowed recovery, then smallpox. The kid didn't die from smallpox.","Topic 1, person"
Who developed the smallpox vaccine? How?,"It was developed by Jenner. 

Observed that milkmaids did not contract smallpox. Concluded that cowpox infection gave resistance to smallpox. He infected a child with cowpox, allowed recovery, then smallpox. The kid didn't die from smallpox.","Topic 1, person"
Why is the first vaccine considered 'controversial' in its origins?,"The first trial was human experimentation without informed consent. Jenner inoculated a local boy, without any clinical testing. It would be considered highly unethical today.","Topic 1, person"
What is the name of the first vaccine recipient? What disease was he inoculated form?,James Phipps was the first recipient of the smallpox vaccine.,"Topic 1, person"
What is the major contribution of James Phipps?,"He was the first vaccine recipient - he didn't die from smallpox after being infected with cowpox.

He also stopped the Nazi's from raiding Jenner's tomb.","Topic 1, person"
